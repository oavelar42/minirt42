# miniRT
The beautiful world of Raytracing. 
- When it comes to rendering 3 dimensional computer generated images there are 2 possible approaches: “Rasterization”, which is used by almost all graphic engines because of it’s efficiency and “Ray Tracing.”
- The “Ray Tracing” method, developed for the first time in 1968 (but improved upon since) is even today more expensive in computation than the “Rasterization” method.
- As a result it is not well adapted to real time usecases but it produces a much higher degree of visual realism.
- This project done for MAC's and Linux ... for run you need to make ... created "RT" and do ./miniRT <scenes>/<name.rt>
